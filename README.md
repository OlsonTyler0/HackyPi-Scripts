# HackyPi Scripts
 A collection of scripts I've written for HackyPi. 
 All you need to do for these scripts to work is to replace the code.py file with this code
---
These are not built to be installed on a regular system, and can only be run on the device
Most of these were built with thonny in order to test code as I went.
