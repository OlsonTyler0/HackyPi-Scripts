# HackyPi Scripts
 A collection of scripts I've written for HackyPi just toying around with it. 
 I have files for actual use and just fun hackey ones. Just see for youself!
 All you have to do is update their names to code.py in order to run it on the hackypi

LIB = Contains the Library of files used by hackypi. This is just here for resources, I don't own the content

GIF = This folder contains gif code. Attempts to use to display gifs on the hackyPi
